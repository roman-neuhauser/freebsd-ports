s6-networking is a suite of small networking utilities for Unix systems.
It includes command-line client and server management, TCP access
control, privilege escalation across UNIX domain sockets, IDENT protocol
management and clock synchronization. Optionally, it also includes
command-line TLS/SSL tools for secure communications.

If the underlying skalibs has been compiled with IPv6 support,
s6-networking is IPv6-ready.
